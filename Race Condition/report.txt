Part 0: (increment.c)

In this part, I ran the file with the following command:
./increment 10 foo.txt 
and it worked fine .
(Please let Dr. Nemo know that it is ./increment that we have to run not just increment. That part got me super confused and threw me off because I am not familair with command prompt. Please let him know! Thank you!)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1: consecutive.c

I implemented this file by taking in file name via scanf. So this is different from how Dr.Nemo's increment.c is implement.
I ran:

./consecutive
bar.txt

and got expected input of

5 : 5
6 : 5
6 : 5
7 : 16


---------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2: spawn.c

When I ran this with a really large number of child process, like 500, I got this error message: 
"fork failed: Resource temporarily unavailable".  

(the command I ran was: ./spawn 500 "increment 20 foo.txt". If I had run anything bigger than this, it would have failed again)

But when I checked the content of my foo.txt with the  following command (again, this is input through scanf):

./consecutive 
foo.txt

I did not see any race condition because the consecutive file did not print out anything (that means everything gets increment by 1 succesfully)
And because of that, I am not sure how to indicate where the critical section is. Sorry.
